### ASCII ANIMATION 

ASCII animation involves rapidly displaying a sequence of pictures made from text characters. ASCII art has a long
history as a way to draw pictures for text-only monitors or printers. We will draw animated ASCII art, or
"ASCIImation." Groups of movie buffs are working to recreate in their entirety Star Wars and The Matrix as
ASCIImation.
